# SnapLink - Photography Booking Platform

Smartphone photography is booming, but finding the right **photographers** and **venues** is still fragmented and unorganized.  
Most users rely on informal social media groups, which lack trust, accessibility, and professionalism.

**SnapLink** solves this problem by offering an **all-in-one platform** that connects photography enthusiasts, photographers, and venue owners.  
It enables users to **discover, book, and manage** photography sessions and venues in one streamlined system.
